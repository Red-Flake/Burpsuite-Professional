# NixOS Installation
## Add this repo's flake to your flake inputs
```
# flake.nix
{
  # ...
  inputs = {
    burpsuitepro = {
      type = "github";
      owner = "xiv3r";
      repo = "Burpsuite-Professional";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };
  # ...
}
```

## Installing the package provided by the flake
### You can install it with either `environment.systemPackages` or `home.packages`
> With `environment.systemPackages` (nixosModules)

  ```
    { inputs, ... }: {
      environment.systemPackages = [
        inputs.burpsuitepro.packages.${system}.default
      ];
    }
  ```

> With `home.packages` (home-manager)
 ```
    { inputs, ... }: {
      home.packages = [
        inputs.burpsuitepro.packages.${system}.default
      ];
    }
  ```

NOTE: `loader.jar` is symlinked to `burpsuite.jar` so burpsuite recognizes the license keys. You can access the `loader` command from the terminal only
